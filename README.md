1. Capomulin and Ramicane had the shortest average regimens in the group of regimens. They also had the most data points which helps back up results that it was an effecctive treatment. They also had the shortest variance which helps to show more consistency in treatment as opposed to fewer, more spread out datapoints. With a near 50/50 split of male/female it can also show a good representation of how the drugs affect people based on gender.â€¨

2. Capomulin treatments for mouse b742 led to a steep declind in tumor volume. Even though the volume drops quickly at day 20 it does climb in the next 15 days with another decline. More time would be needed to make sure that the tumors continue to decrease or watch to see if tumor volumes come back with more time. Shortest regimen doesn't necessarily mean most effective as there can be a quick reaction, but not enough to cause an illness to be controlled.

3. From the scatter plot we can see that the bigger the subject the bigger the average tumor volume. This could show that the quality of the subjects health helps to indicate the amount of tumors a subject can have.  The smaller and healthier the subject the better in terms of smaller tumor volume.
